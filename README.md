# Badger

It might be nice to gift badges and track achievements for deserving people.

## FAQ
* Hasn't this been done before?
    * Yes, [at least once][bravonation].
* Why are you doing it, then?
    * Because I'd like to:
        1. Revive the idea; 
        2. Make it more generative and participatory;
        3. Introduce automated web-wide scanning for achievement conditions.
* Why's it all Comic Sans?
    * Because I want to annoy you into fixing it for me.
    * Also, because it's all still a prototype.
