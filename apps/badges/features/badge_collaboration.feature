Feature: Badge collaboration
    As a nice person with badge ideas
    I want to be able to contribute to badges
    In order to allow myself and others to reward interesting behavior

    @TODO
    Scenario: Badges should offer an image editor
        Given # Whiz-bang HTML5 image editor / clip art composer

    @TODO
    Scenario: Badge creators should be able to mark badge elements as help-wanted
        Given # A help-wanted flag indicates a badge needs help
        Given # Help wanted from writers, illustrators, programmers, delegates

    @TODO
    Scenario: Badge elements marked as help-wanted should be browseable
        Given # A writer should be able to find badges in need of description
        Given # An illustrator should be able to find badges in need of images
        Given # A programmer should be able to find badges in need of rules
        Given # Users should be able to find badges in need of delegates
