Feature: Collecting random things Badger should do
    As a lazy developer
    I want to collect miscellaneous things
    In order to remember to implement them

    @TODO
    Scenario: Implement a do-not-email list
        # Store salted SHA256 hash of email address
        # Block outgoing emails on detection of email present in list
