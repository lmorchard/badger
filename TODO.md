# TODO

* For award-by-email, if the email matches the verified email of an existing user, switch to the user rather than using the verification code system?

* Sprinkle in more AJAX / hidden iframe / facebox magic for in-place submissions

* Strip out more unused Pinax apps / features
** No "friends" / "invites" from friends_app?
** No "about" app?

* Extend award-by-email to also send verification URLs by IM / Twitter / etc

* Make subjects of emails more descriptive, so gmail doesn't pile them up into threads

* Switch from disclosing database IDs in URLs to UUIDs? 6-character {a-zA-Z0-9} strings?

* HTML5 badge image editor / composer
** See also: http://wallpapers.foxkeh.com/en/

* Autocomplete on user names for badge nomination

* Combined search-or-create interface for exploring badges?
** See also quora.
** Useful for finding and settling on existing badges before creating an inadvertant variant

* Allow badger app to be more reusable by checking for installation of notification, etc?
