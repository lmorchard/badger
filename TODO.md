# TODO

## v0.1

* List of latest awarded badges on home page

* Feeds - JSON, Atom (activity streams?)

* Hide / show awards on profile page

* Creator-only for nominations

* Non-listed badges for surprises

* Invitation-only at launch?

* Pagination on badges page?

## v0.2

* Karma? Applause? Mood?

* API using valet keys and checkbox capabilities

* Delegation of nomination approval

* Comments

* Tags

* Search-then-create

## Future

* Denormalize badge / badgeaward / badgeawardee / user joins down to badge / badgeaward

* For award-by-email, if the email matches the verified email of an existing user, switch to the user rather than using the verification code system?

* Sprinkle in more AJAX / hidden iframe / facebox magic for in-place submissions

* Strip out more unused Pinax apps / features
** No "friends" / "invites" from friends_app?
** No "about" app?

* Extend award-by-email to also send verification URLs by IM / Twitter / etc

* Make subjects of emails more descriptive, so gmail doesn't pile them up into threads

* Switch from disclosing database IDs in URLs to UUIDs? 6-character {a-zA-Z0-9} strings?

* HTML5 badge image editor / composer

* Autocomplete on user names for badge nomination

* Combined search-or-create interface for exploring badges?
** See also quora.
** Useful for finding and settling on existing badges before creating an inadvertant variant

* Allow badger app to be more reusable by checking for installation of notification, etc?

* Wishlist of badges
